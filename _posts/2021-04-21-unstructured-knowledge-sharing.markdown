- Ash wrote about _structured_ knowledge shares - /blog/2020/12/09/share-your-knowledge/
  - but we do some good _unstructured_ knowledge sharing. Not scheduled, ad hoc.
  - probably link somewhere to knowledge sharing as a core principle in some docs somewhere?
- The dev-help slack channel - cc @damassi https://twitter.com/ArtsyOpenSource/status/1357819867638812672
  - a place to ask technical questions when you're stuck
  - we've built a large knowledge-base
  - link to auto-solved bot
  - sometimes it's not a question - it's something we already figured out but thought it was worth sharing (contribution to the knowledge base)
  - anything interesting to say about using tooling you already have (slack)? 
- Firing up ad hoc zooms - we've been doing more and more of this lately and it's what prompted me to request this post. 
  - Sometimes they're more informative, like when @anandaroop recently spun up a zoom to walk through how he'd use observable to explore artist search index weighting.
    - kind of like streaming but for your coworkers
  - Sometimes they're more of a mobbing exercise, like when @admbtlr recently spun one up to work on some react-native navigation refactoring.
  - In all cases they're a "push" instead of a "pull"
    - radiating intent on what you plan on working on
    - giving the rest of the team an opportunity to learn
      - or contribute if they've got expertise
- Pairing - this isn't an unusual practice and @yuki24 wrote it about in 2018 (/blog/2018/10/19/pair-programming/)
  - but I think we're pretty good at it as an org and it's a big part of our unstructured knowledge sharing
  - What _is_ different from many places is that we don't just do it when we're stuck, we do it to build features
  - Knowlege-sharing of more than just code & product -- how do I approach a problem, what's my tooling, what are my techniques for debugging/testing/tightening my feedback loop
  - We tend to focus on pairing within a team; could probably do more cross-team pairing
- Sharing via PRs
  - link to article on context in PRs


Thought: If I expand this to include unstructured & structured things not covered by Ash's article, I can include: 
- "office hours"
- show & tell/lunch & learn
- peer learning groups
