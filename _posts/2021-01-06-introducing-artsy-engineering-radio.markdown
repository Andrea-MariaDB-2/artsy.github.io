Available now [on iTunes][itunes] and hopefully your preferred podcast provider ðŸ¤ž is Artsy Engineering Radio!
We'll release new episodes every other week. Our target episode length is 30 minutes. Some episodes will be
technical and others less so. Because [we work in the open][open-source-by-default] it's easy for us to talk about
our work in public.

Solving problems in the world of software engineering can mean a lot of different things, and this podcast will
explore what that looks like at Artsy. If you've followed our blog, you can expect a podcast that sounds like it.
There are a ton of amazing engineers here at Artsy and we're excited for you to hear their voices and stories. Our
hope is that this podcast will reduce the friction and get more contributions shared with the world.

This isn't the first attempt at an Artsy engineering podcast! Our engineering team has attempted multiple times to
start one but they fizzled. In fact, when [Jon][jon] went to create new Slack and Notion hubs, he found that both
already existed. We're beating the fizzle this time, though. We've got momentum and enthusiasm on our side â€”
several episodes are already recorded, a couple are already published. Instead of tinkering with tooling we're
focusing on making episodes, even if they aren't perfect. Like the software we build, the podcast will get better
over time as we iterate.

What do we have so far? In [episode 0][episode-0], [Jon][jon], [Matt][matt], and [Steve][steve] introduced the
podcast and talked about what you can expect from future episodes. [Episode 1][episode-1] features a conversation
with [Ash][ash] about facilitating meaningful and inclusive team meetings, and how meetings are part of building
teams, trust, and systems.

Find episodes 0 and 1 right now in your podcast player. Watch for future episodes in your feed and we'll announce
them [on Twitter][twitter] when they're released.
